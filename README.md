##What is Zombie code?

I was shocked to see how well maintained and upgraded dead code can get. I assumed naievly that dead code was just that - dead. 
Sure it got in the way a bit and was better off being deleted, but I assumed if it wasn't used, people wouldn't be maintaining it.

Of course, if you're new to a project and someone says upgrade X, you're going to find every reference to X and ensure it's upgraded. 
Alas not enough people question whether the code is actually used at all and can be removed safely.

Here's an overview of some of the reason Zombie Code is bad:
